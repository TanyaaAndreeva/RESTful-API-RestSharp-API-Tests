## StorySpoil API Testing with RestSharp
This project demonstrates how to interact with a RESTful API using RestSharp within a .NET test project. The main objective of this task was to create a set of automated tests that validate key functionalities of the StorySpoil API.

The project includes tests for creating, editing, and deleting story spoilers via the API, as well as handling edge cases such as missing fields or non-existing stories.

# ðŸ›  Technologies Used
.NET (NUnit for testing)

RestSharp (for making API requests)

JWT Authentication (for securing the API requests)

NUnit (for writing and running the tests)
